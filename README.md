jQuery Snippets for Emacs and Yasnippet
=======================================

I like my template completions. And I like them to be provided by
yassnippet. Yasnippet is here:
https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet 

I wasn't satisfied with existing jQuery yas snippet collections,
including one that I'd contributed to. So I made this collection.

Works best with a auto-complete-mode dict that includes completions
for jQuery functions
